# Sandstorm Error Collector

Sandstorm Error Collector is a utility grain purpose-built to collect error reports from the Sandstorm install script. However, it is generic enough that it may be useful for collecting other error reports.

## Using the collector

The grain UI provides both offer templates to generate valid API keys, as well as a sample command to test the collector. Note that offer templates are not persistent unless used at least once. For this reason, you may find it preferable to create a webkey instead, and then insert the correct parts into the examples provided by the offer templates themselves.
